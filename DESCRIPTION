Description: This package provides a clustering algorithm for single-cell RNA seq data, that uses model distribution fitting and assumes that similar cell types have similar gene expression patterns to infer a dissimilarity matrix on which is applied a complete-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm. README is about the assumptions and exact computations performed in the algorithm.
